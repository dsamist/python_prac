Mission 1: Write a program which fulfills the requirements below
Description
We want you to calculate the sum of squares of given integers, excluding any negatives.
The first line of the input will be an integer N (1 <= N <= 100), indicating the number of test cases to follow.
Each of the test cases will consist of a line with an integer X (0 < X <= 100), followed by another line consisting of X number of space-separated integers Yn (-100 <= Yn <= 100).
For each test case, calculate the sum of squares of the integers, excluding any negatives, and print the calculated sum in the output.
Note: There should be no output until all the input has been received.
Note 2: Do not put blank lines between test cases solutions.
Note 3: Take input from standard input, and output to standard output.
Rules
Write your solution using Go Programming Language or Python Programming Language. Do not submit your solution with both languages at once!

You may only use standard library packages. In addition, extra point is awarded if solution does not declare any global variables.

Specific rules for Python solution
Your source code must be a single file, containing at least a main function
Do not use any for loop, while loop, or any list / set / dictionary comprehension
Your solution will be tested against Python 3.11 (as of February 2023) or higher

Authorization
The URL is protected by HTTP Basic Authentication, which is explained on Chapter 2 of RFC2617, so you have to provide an Authorization: header field in your POST request

For the userid of HTTP Basic Authentication, use the same email address you put in the JSON string.
For the password, provide a 10-digit time-based one time password conforming to RFC6238 TOTP.
Authorization password
For generating the TOTP password, you will need to use the following setup:

You have to read RFC6238 (and the errata too!) and get a correct one time password by yourself.
TOTP's Time Step X is 30 seconds. T0 is 0.
Use HMAC-SHA-512 for the hash function, instead of the default HMAC-SHA-1.
Token shared secret is the userid followed by ASCII string value "HENNGECHALLENGE003" (not including double quotations).
